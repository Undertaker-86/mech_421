\section{Concept}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{Goal and Vision}
We will build a simplified version of Caltech's Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot (M4). The original M4 platform can transform between six locomotion modes; however, due to time and resource constraints, we narrow our scope to two high-impact modes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ground Mode:} Agile wheeled driving suitable for indoor environments.
    \item \textbf{Flight Mode:} Short-hop quadrotor flight for obstacle traversal.
\end{itemize}

Our goal is to design and build a morphing robot that can switch between these two modes. We want to learn as much as possible from this project, so we will implement the following components from scratch:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mechanical design and transformation mechanism
    \item Custom flight controller firmware
    \item Control system tuning
    \item Power distribution system
\end{itemize}

We recognize the complexity of designing these components. Building a flight controller alone requires deep understanding of control theory, sensor fusion, and embedded systems. However, this is our final year and we want to end it with a challenging project that pushes our abilities.

The vision is that by utilizing the same set of rotor-wheel appendages, we create a more versatile locomotion device capable of handling multiple scenarios. For example, the robot could drive efficiently through a building's corridors to survey damage, then switch to flight mode to cross a collapsed stairwell or navigate between floors through an open atrium.

    \caption{Caltech's M4 Robot, the inspiration for our project. The M4 demonstrates six locomotion modes through appendage repurposing.}
    \label{fig:m4_reference}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Form Factor and Operating Concept}
The robot resembles a remote-control car with four motorized wheels arranged in an ``X'' pattern on a central frame. What makes it special is that each wheel is part of a convertible rotor-wheel pod: essentially a propeller enclosed in a protective duct with a tire attached to its outer rim.

When driving on the ground, the pods lock flat at 0\,$^\circ$ and the motors spin the tires like a normal RC car. When the robot needs to fly (to get over obstacles or climb stairs), the four pods tilt upward to a 90\,$^\circ$ angle, the propellers spin up, and the whole system transforms into a quadcopter. Since the robot will be heavy, our goal is to provide enough flight time to hop over barriers and reach new locations, not sustained high-altitude flight.

Switching between driving and flying modes should be quick, targeting under 10 seconds. The transformation happens through motorized linear actuators that move the arms into preset positions, with Hall-effect sensors providing feedback to confirm correct positioning. An operator controls everything from an RC controller, deciding when to drive and when to take flight based on obstacles ahead.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{2modes.jpeg}
    \caption{Conceptual sketch of the Transformer Robot in Ground Mode (left) and Flight Mode (right). The rotor-wheel pods rotate 90 degrees to switch between locomotion modes.}
    \label{fig:two_modes}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Conceptual Interest and Motivation}
The most compelling idea is appendage repurposing, similar to how animals use their limbs for multiple functions. We must design a single electromechanical module that provides traction, thrust, and stabilization, echoing M4's research insight while staying achievable within MECH 421/423 constraints.

Both of us want to pursue further study in mobile robot navigation. Unlike typical drones or rovers whose navigation algorithms are well studied, a morphing robot presents new challenges in state estimation, control, and path planning. This project exposes us to topics we want to research in graduate school.

Finally, we think it is just cool. While this robot has practical applications in search-and-rescue, the real motivation is the challenge and learning experience. Even if the final prototype does not achieve full autonomous transitions, the process of designing the transformation mechanism, creating a working PCB, integrating control systems, and wrestling with state estimation problems will teach us more than building yet another standard quadcopter or RC car.

\section{Answers to Questions from Concept Proposal}
%==============================================================================

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Q\arabic*:}, leftmargin=0pt, itemsep=1.2em]

\item \textbf{What is the value of your product to the end-user?}

The added flexibility from multiple modes allows a single robot to handle various scenarios. Urban search-and-rescue teams gain a robot that can roll quietly through doorways and then quickly hop over collapsed stair segments to reach trapped occupants. The operator stays at street level, teleoperates wheeled inspection, and only flies when debris gaps appear. This approach minimizes battery use while preserving access flexibility, shortening mission timelines and reducing the number of specialized robots responders must deploy.

Beyond emergency response, this technology could find applications in space exploration (planetary rovers that can fly over obstacles), agriculture (ground surveys with aerial overviews), military reconnaissance (driving through urban environments and flying over barriers), and environmental monitoring (ground-level data collection with aerial mapping).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{use_case.png}
    \caption{Search and rescue storyboard illustrating the value proposition. The robot drives through accessible areas and flies over obstacles, enabling a single device to navigate complex disaster environments.}
    \label{fig:use_case}
\end{figure}

For our demonstration, we will show that the robot can navigate through tight spaces that a typical drone cannot pass through by switching to wheeled mode.

\item \textbf{What is the closest alternative to your product?}

Since our project is inspired by Caltech's M4, their research represents the closest alternative. The M4 robot demonstrates six locomotion modes including wheeled driving, flying, walking, and tumbling.

Other academic prototypes include Caltech's ATMO (Aerially Transforming Morphobot), which uses four thrusters that double as wheels and can transform between quadcopter and ground rover modes using a single motor mechanism. Virginia Tech has developed a bistable morphing robot using shape memory alloy actuators that rapidly switches between flying and driving configurations in under 50 milliseconds.

Outside research prototypes, there is no direct commercial equivalent. The practical alternative is using two separate robots: a standard quadcopter for aerial reconnaissance and an RC car or small ground rover for close-up inspection. This is what most hobbyists and professional applications currently do, switching between devices based on terrain.

\item \textbf{What is the metric of success for your product? How will you measure it?}

We will declare success if the robot:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Completes a ground-to-flight-to-ground cycle in under 20\,s
    \item Sustains 0.8\,m/s average speed in drive mode for 15\,m
    \item Performs a 5\,m horizontal flight hop carrying its full chassis
\end{enumerate}

We will use timing gates for transformation measurements, encoder logs for ground speed verification, and visual markers or motion capture for flight distance quantification.

\item \textbf{Pick one aspect to polish to a finished product.}

The mechanical morphing mechanism and locking system will reach a polished standard. This means:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Smooth bearing-supported hinges with minimal play
    \item Hidden wiring routed through the frame
    \item Positive locking detents that audibly click into position
    \item Protective covers that shield components during takeoff
\end{itemize}

A rough prototype with visible wobble, exposed wires, or detents that need hand assistance is explicitly unacceptable and will be engineered out through iterative design and cable management.

\item \textbf{Which aspects will you not develop to a finished product?}

Full autonomy will not be achieved, though we will implement enough for safe operation. We will run RC teleoperation and simple attitude stabilization, but we will not harden SLAM, obstacle avoidance, or object detection. Most movement will rely on manual operation.

Additionally, features requiring datasets and validation (such as machine learning models) will not be implemented due to time constraints and our limited experience running ML models on embedded systems.

\item \textbf{What is your most critical module and why?}

The convertible rotor-wheel pod (FC2) is most critical because it must satisfy conflicting requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Structural stiffness for fast driving over bumps
    \item Low mass for adequate flight performance
    \item Precise alignment for vibration-free hover
\end{itemize}

Failure to meet any requirement instantly degrades both locomotion modes. We will prototype this module first, run torsion and balance tests, and only then replicate it across all four corners.

\item \textbf{What kind of data infrastructure will you need? How will you test it?}

Our data infrastructure will stream wheel encoder ticks, IMU data, actuator position, current draw, and controller state vectors over serial to a logging laptop. A Python-based logging system will archive every trial with timestamps.

We will inject mock data using software simulation to ensure the telemetry pipeline handles expected bandwidth. We will then run hardware-in-the-loop bench tests where the Teensy publishes synthetic data while actuators report real motion, verifying synchronization before field trials.

\end{enumerate}

%==============================================================================
\section{Most Critical Module}
%==============================================================================

The most critical module is \textbf{FC2: Rotor-Wheel Pod Assembly}. This module faces the fundamental challenge of serving two masters: it must function as both a reliable ground wheel and an efficient aerial propulsion unit.

\subsection{Challenges}

\textbf{Conflicting Structural Requirements:} Ground driving subjects the pod to impact loads from bumps and curbs, demanding stiffness and durability. Flight requires minimal rotating mass for responsive attitude control and efficient hover. These requirements directly conflict.

\textbf{Vibration and Balance:} An unbalanced rotating assembly causes vibrations that degrade flight stability and accelerometer readings. The tire bonded to the propeller duct adds asymmetric mass that must be carefully balanced.

\textbf{Thermal Management:} Motors operating near their limits during flight generate significant heat. The enclosed duct design that protects the propeller also restricts airflow for cooling.

\textbf{Manufacturing Tolerances:} Four identical pods must be produced with tight tolerances. Variations in mass distribution or alignment between pods cause the flight controller to work harder to maintain stability.

\subsection{Work Done So Far}

We have completed preliminary CAD design of the rotor-wheel pod assembly, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 3D models of the duct, hub, and tire attachment mechanism
    \item Structural analysis of the arm connection points
    \item Initial motor and propeller selection based on thrust calculations
\end{itemize}

The CAD files are located in the project repository under \texttt{/CAD/Transforming+Quadcopter/}.

\subsection{Remaining Work}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 3D print a single prototype pod for fit and function testing
    \item Conduct static thrust tests to verify motor and propeller performance
    \item Perform dynamic balancing using a balancing jig
    \item Measure vibration spectrum during operation
    \item Iterate on design based on test results
    \item Replicate the final design for all four pods
\end{enumerate}

Detailed development and test plans are provided in Section~\ref{sec:fc2}.

%==============================================================================
\section{FC1: Morphing Airframe and Transformation Mechanism}
\label{sec:fc1}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{Approach and Design}

The morphing airframe provides the structural backbone of the robot and houses the transformation mechanism that switches between ground and flight modes.

\textbf{Objective:} Create a rigid yet lightweight frame that supports all components and enables reliable, repeatable transformation between locomotion modes.

\textbf{Frame Construction:} The main chassis consists of two carbon fiber plates (2\,mm thickness, 300x200\,mm) forming top and bottom decks connected by aluminum standoffs. This sandwich construction provides excellent stiffness-to-weight ratio.

\textbf{Transformation Mechanism:} Each rotor-wheel pod is mounted on a pivoting arm. Linear actuators drive the arms between two positions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ground mode: Arms horizontal (0\,$^\circ$)
    \item Flight mode: Arms vertical (90\,$^\circ$)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Position Feedback:} Hall-effect sensors at each pivot detect magnets embedded in the arms, providing binary feedback for locked positions. This allows the controller to verify successful transformation before enabling the appropriate control mode.

\subsection{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ground angle:} 0\,$^\circ$ (horizontal arms)

%==============================================================================
\section{FC2: Rotor-Wheel Pod Assembly}
\label{sec:fc2}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{Approach and Design}

The rotor-wheel pod is the defining feature of the transformer robot, serving as both wheel and propulsion unit.

\textbf{Objective:} Create a module that provides ground traction when horizontal and aerial thrust when vertical, using shared mechanical components.

\textbf{Pod Construction:} Each pod consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Brushless motor:} 2812 Pro 1100\,KV mounted at the center
    \item \textbf{Propeller:} 8-inch or 9-inch propeller attached to motor shaft
    \item \textbf{Duct:} 3D-printed shroud surrounding the propeller for protection and efficiency
    \item \textbf{Tire:} Rubber tire bonded to the outer rim of the duct
    \item \textbf{Hub:} Central hub connecting the pod to the pivot arm
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Operating Modes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ground mode:} Motor spins the entire pod assembly; tire contacts ground for traction
    \item \textbf{Flight mode:} Motor spins only the propeller; pod body remains stationary
\end{itemize}

A clutch mechanism (or separate drive motors) may be needed to decouple the propeller from the duct during ground operation. Initial prototypes will test both approaches.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Motor KV rating:} 1100\,KV (RPM per volt)
    \item \textbf{Propeller size:} 8x4.5 or 9x5 inches (diameter x pitch)
    \item \textbf{Tire outer diameter:} 100\,mm
    \item \textbf{Duct inner clearance:} 2\,mm tip gap
    \item \textbf{Pod total mass:} Target $<$ 300\,g
    \item \textbf{Static thrust:} Target $>$ 800\,g per pod at full throttle
\end{itemize}

Propeller pitch affects both thrust and efficiency. Higher pitch provides more thrust but requires more power. We will test multiple propeller options to find the best balance.

\subsection{Development Plan}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Finalize single pod CAD design
    \item 3D print duct and hub components
    \item Assemble prototype with motor and propeller (without tire initially)
    \item Conduct static thrust test on test stand
    \item Add tire and repeat thrust test to measure impact
    \item Perform dynamic balancing using a balancing jig
    \item Measure vibration spectrum with accelerometer
    \item Iterate design based on results
    \item Produce four matched pods for final assembly

\label{sec:fc3}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{Approach and Design}

The power electronics subsystem manages energy distribution from the battery to all motors and provides regulated power for control electronics.

\textbf{Objective:} Deliver reliable power to all actuators while protecting against overcurrent, undervoltage, and reverse polarity conditions.

    \item \textbf{Flight ESCs:} 4-in-1 45\,A ESC stack for the four flight motors
    \item \textbf{Drive ESCs:} Two 35\,A bidirectional ESCs for ground drive motors (5010 360\,KV)
    \item \textbf{Actuator drivers:} Two DRV8871 H-bridge modules for linear actuators

\subsection{Data Rates and Bandwidth}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Data Rate Requirements}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Data Source} & \textbf{Sample Rate} & \textbf{Bytes/sec} \\
\midrule
IMU (6-axis) & 1000\,Hz & 12,000 \\

%==============================================================================
\section{Engineering Calculations}
%==============================================================================

This section presents the engineering calculations that justify our component selections.

\subsection{Mass Budget}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Estimated Mass Budget}
\label{tab:mass_budget}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lrl@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Mass (g)} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\midrule
Carbon fiber frame & 200 & Two 300x200x2mm plates \\
Rotor-wheel pods (x4) & 1200 & 300g each including motor \\
Linear actuators (x2) & 200 & 100g each \\
Batteries (x2) & 400 & 200g each (6S 2200mAh) \\
Electronics & 150 & Teensy, ESCs, PDB, wiring \\
Servos and misc & 100 & DS3225 x2 plus hardware \\
\midrule
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{2250} & \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Design margin: Target $<$ 2.5\,kg total mass.

\subsection{Motor Thrust Calculation}

For stable hover, total thrust must exceed weight. For agile flight, we target a thrust-to-weight ratio of 2:1.

\textbf{Required total thrust:}
\begin{equation}
T_{total} = 2 \times m \times g = 2 \times 2.5\,\text{kg} \times 9.81\,\text{m/s}^2 = 49.1\,\text{N}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Required thrust per motor:}
\begin{equation}
T_{motor} = \frac{T_{total}}{4} = \frac{49.1\,\text{N}}{4} = 12.3\,\text{N} \approx 1250\,\text{g}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Selected motor analysis:}

The 2812 Pro 1100\,KV motor with 8-inch propeller produces approximately 800\,g thrust at full throttle according to manufacturer data. This gives:

\begin{equation}
\text{T/W ratio} = \frac{4 \times 800\,\text{g}}{2500\,\text{g}} = \frac{3200}{2500} = 1.28
\end{equation}

This is below our target of 2.0. \textbf{Mitigation options:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Upgrade to 9-inch propellers (estimated 1000\,g/motor) $\rightarrow$ T/W = 1.6
    \item Reduce total mass through design optimization
    \item Accept lower agility for initial prototype
\end{enumerate}

For the initial prototype, we will proceed with T/W = 1.28 and verify hover stability before considering upgrades.

\subsection{Servo Torque Calculation}

The transformation servos must lift the rotor-wheel pod mass against gravity.

\textbf{Pod mass:} $m_{pod} = 300\,\text{g} = 0.3\,\text{kg}$

\textbf{Arm length to center of mass:} $r = 150\,\text{mm} = 0.15\,\text{m}$

\textbf{Required torque (worst case, arm horizontal):}
\begin{equation}
\tau = m_{pod} \times g \times r = 0.3\,\text{kg} \times 9.81\,\text{m/s}^2 \times 0.15\,\text{m} = 0.44\,\text{Nm}
\end{equation}

Converting to kg-cm:
\begin{equation}
\tau = 0.44\,\text{Nm} \times \frac{100\,\text{cm}}{1\,\text{m}} \times \frac{1\,\text{kg}}{9.81\,\text{N}} = 4.5\,\text{kg-cm}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Selected servo:} DS3225 rated at 25\,kg-cm

\textbf{Safety factor:}
\begin{equation}
SF = \frac{25}{4.5} = 5.5
\end{equation}

This provides excellent margin for dynamic loads during transformation.

\subsection{Linear Actuator Force Calculation}

The linear actuators assist the servos in transformation. We analyze the force required.

Assuming the actuator pushes on the arm at a 45$^\circ$ angle to the pivot:

\textbf{Mechanical advantage:} Approximately 1.5 based on geometry

\textbf{Required actuator force:}
\begin{equation}
F_{act} = \frac{m_{pod} \times g}{MA} \times SF = \frac{0.3\,\text{kg} \times 9.81\,\text{m/s}^2}{1.5} \times 2 = 3.9\,\text{N}
\end{equation}

The original 60\,N actuator would seem sufficient, but this calculation ignores:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Friction in the pivot bearings
    \item Dynamic loads from acceleration
    \item Stall force derating
\end{itemize}

The BOM notes recommend upgrading to 150\,N or higher for reliable operation. We will use 150\,N actuators.

\subsection{Battery Sizing Calculation}

\textbf{Flight power consumption (estimated):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each motor at hover: 10\,A (estimated from motor specs)
    \item Total flight current: $4 \times 10\,\text{A} = 40\,\text{A}$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Battery capacity:} 6S 2200\,mAh = 2.2\,Ah

\textbf{Hover time (80\% usable capacity):}
\begin{equation}
t_{hover} = \frac{0.8 \times 2.2\,\text{Ah}}{40\,\text{A}} \times 60\,\text{min/hr} = 2.6\,\text{min}
\end{equation}

This is sufficient for short hop maneuvers. With two batteries, we have 5.2 minutes total hover time.

\textbf{Battery discharge rate verification:}

Peak current (full throttle, 4 motors): $4 \times 25\,\text{A} = 100\,\text{A}$

Required C-rating:
\begin{equation}
C = \frac{100\,\text{A}}{2.2\,\text{Ah}} = 45C
\end{equation}

Selected battery: 150C rating $\rightarrow$ Max discharge = $150 \times 2.2\,\text{A} = 330\,\text{A}$

This provides excellent margin for peak demands.

\subsection{Structural Analysis}

\textbf{Carbon fiber plate bending:}

For a simply supported plate with center load:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{max} = \frac{6 \times P \times L}{b \times t^2}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P = 25\,\text{N}$ (point load from battery)
    \item $L = 150\,\text{mm}$ (half span)
    \item $b = 200\,\text{mm}$ (width)
    \item $t = 2\,\text{mm}$ (thickness)
