1.2 Applications
• Home Automation • Sensor Management
• Security • Data Acquisition
CAUTION These products use FRAM nonvolatile memory technology. FRAM retention is sensitive to extreme temperatures,
such as those experienced during reflow or hand soldering. See Absolute Maximum Ratings for more information.
CAUTION System-level ESD protection must be applied in compliance with the device-level ESD specification to prevent
electrical overstress or disturb of data or code memory. See the application report MSP430™ System-Level ESD
Considerations (SLAA530) for more information.
1.3 Description
The Texas Instruments MSP430FR573x family of ultra-low-power microcontrollers consists of multiple
devices that feature embedded FRAM nonvolatile memory, ultra-low-power 16-bit MSP430™ CPU, and
different peripherals targeted for various applications. The architecture, FRAM, and peripherals, combined
with seven low-power modes, are optimized to achieve extended battery life in portable and wireless
sensing applications. FRAM is a new nonvolatile memory that combines the speed, flexibility, and
endurance of SRAM with the stability and reliability of flash, all at lower total power consumption.
Peripherals include a 10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a 16-channel comparator with voltage
reference generation and hysteresis capabilities, three enhanced serial channels capable of I2C, SPI, or
UART protocols, an internal DMA, a hardware multiplier, an RTC, five 16-bit timers, and digital I/Os.

(1) All inputs are tied to 0 V or to VCC. Outputs do not source or sink any current.
(2) The currents are characterized with a Micro Crystal CC4V-T1A SMD crystal with a load capacitance of 9 pF. The internal and external
load capacitance are chosen to closely match the required 9 pF.
(3) Characterized with program executing typical data processing.
(4) At MCLK frequencies above 8 MHz, the FRAM requires wait states. When wait states are required, the effective MCLK frequency,
ƒMCLK,eff, decreases. The effective MCLK frequency is also dependent on the cache hit ratio. SMCLK is not affected by the number of
wait states or the cache hit ratio. The following equation can be used to compute ƒMCLK,eff:
(5) Program and data reside entirely in FRAM. No wait states enabled. DCORSEL = 0, DCOFSELx = 3 (ƒDCO = 8 MHz). MCLK = SMCLK.
(6) Program resides in FRAM. Data resides in SRAM. Average current dissipation varies with cache hit-to-miss ratio as specified. Cache hit
ratio represents number cache accesses divided by the total number of FRAM accesses. For example, a 25% ratio implies one of every
four accesses is from cache, the remaining are FRAM accesses.
For 1, 4, and 8 MHz, DCORSEL = 0, DCOFSELx = 3 (ƒDCO = 8 MHz). MCLK = SMCLK. No wait states enabled.
For 16 MHz, DCORSEL = 1, DCOFSELx = 0 (ƒDCO = 16 MHz). MCLK = SMCLK. One wait state enabled.
For 20 MHz, DCORSEL = 1, DCOFSELx = 2 (ƒDCO = 20 MHz). MCLK = SMCLK. Three wait states enabled.
For 24 MHz, DCORSEL = 1, DCOFSELx = 3 (ƒDCO = 24 MHz). MCLK = SMCLK. Three wait states enabled.
(7) See Figure 4-1 for typical curves. Each characteristic equation shown in the graph is computed using the least squares method for best
linear fit using the typical data shown in Section 4.4.
ƒACLK = 32786 Hz, ƒMCLK = ƒSMCLK at specified frequency. No peripherals active.
XTS = CPUOFF = SCG0 = SCG1 = OSCOFF= SMCLKOFF = 0.
(8) All execution is from RAM.
For 1, 4, and 8 MHz, DCORSEL = 0, DCOFSELx = 3 (ƒDCO = 8 MHz). MCLK = SMCLK.
For 16 MHz, DCORSEL = 1, DCOFSELx = 0 (ƒDCO = 16 MHz). MCLK = SMCLK.
For 20 MHz, DCORSEL = 1, DCOFSELx = 2 (ƒDCO = 20 MHz). MCLK = SMCLK.
For 24 MHz, DCORSEL = 1, DCOFSELx = 3 (ƒDCO = 24 MHz). MCLK = SMCLK.

(1) To improve EMI on the XT1 oscillator, the following guidelines should be observed.
• Keep the trace between the device and the crystal as short as possible.
• Design a good ground plane around the oscillator pins.
• Prevent crosstalk from other clock or data lines into oscillator pins XIN and XOUT.
• Avoid running PCB traces underneath or adjacent to the XIN and XOUT pins.
• Use assembly materials and processes that avoid any parasitic load on the oscillator XIN and XOUT pins.
• If conformal coating is used, ensure that it does not induce capacitive or resistive leakage between the oscillator pins.
(2) –40°C to 85°C
(3) When XT1BYPASS is set, XT1 circuits are automatically powered down. Input signal is a digital square wave with parametrics defined in
the Schmitt-trigger Inputs section of this data sheet.
(4) Maximum frequency of operation of the entire device cannot be exceeded.
(5) Oscillation allowance is based on a safety factor of 5 for recommended crystals. The oscillation allowance is a function of the XT1DRIVE
settings and the effective load. In general, comparable oscillator allowance can be achieved based on the following guidelines, but
should be evaluated based on the actual crystal selected for the application:
• For XT1DRIVE = {0}, CL,eff ≤ 6 pF.
• For XT1DRIVE = {1}, 6 pF ≤ CL,eff ≤ 9 pF.
• For XT1DRIVE = {2}, 6 pF ≤ CL,eff ≤ 10 pF.
• For XT1DRIVE = {3}, 6 pF ≤ CL,eff ≤ 12 pF.
(6) Frequencies below the MIN specification set the fault flag. Frequencies above the MAX specification do not set the fault flag.
Frequencies in between might set the flag.
(7) Measured with logic-level input frequency but also applies to operation with crystals.
(8) Includes startup counter of 4096 clock cycles.
(9) Requires external capacitors at both terminals.
(10) Values are specified by crystal manufacturers. Include parasitic bond and package capacitance (approximately 2 pF per pin).
Recommended values supported are 6 pF, 9 pF, and 12 pF. Maximum shunt capacitance of 1.6 pF.

(1) The external reference is used during ADC conversion to charge and discharge the capacitance array. The input capacitance, Ci, is also
the dynamic load for an external reference during conversion. The dynamic impedance of the reference supply should follow the
recommendations on analog-source impedance to allow the charge to settle for 10-bit accuracy.
(2) The accuracy limits the minimum positive external reference voltage. Lower reference voltage levels may be applied with reduced
accuracy requirements.
(3) The accuracy limits the maximum negative external reference voltage. Higher reference voltage levels may be applied with reduced
accuracy requirements.
(4) The accuracy limits minimum external differential reference voltage. Lower differential reference voltage levels may be applied with
reduced accuracy requirements.
(5) Two decoupling capacitors, 10 µF and 100 nF, should be connected to VREF to decouple the dynamic current required for an external
reference source if it is used for the ADC10_B. Also see the MSP430FR57xx Family User's Guide (SLAU272).

5 Detailed Description
5.1 Functional Block Diagram
This section shows the functional block diagram for the MSP430FR5739-EP in the RHA package.
5.2 CPU
The MSP430 CPU has a 16-bit RISC architecture that is highly transparent to the application. All
operations, other than program-flow instructions, are performed as register operations in conjunction with
seven addressing modes for source operand and four addressing modes for destination operand.
The CPU is integrated with 16 registers that provide reduced instruction execution time. The register-to-
register operation execution time is one cycle of the CPU clock.
Four of the registers, R0 to R3, are dedicated as program counter, stack pointer, status register, and
constant generator, respectively. The remaining registers are general-purpose registers.
Peripherals are connected to the CPU using data, address, and control buses, and can be handled with all
instructions.
The instruction set consists of the original 51 instructions with three formats and seven address modes
and additional instructions for the expanded address range. Each instruction can operate on word and
byte data.
5.3 Operating Modes
The MSP430 has one active mode and seven software-selectable low-power modes of operation. An
interrupt event can wake up the device from low-power modes LPM0 through LPM4, service the request,
and restore back to the low-power mode on return from the interrupt program. Low-power modes LPM3.5
and LPM4.5 disable the core supply to minimize power consumption.
The following eight operating modes can be configured by software:

5.6 Bootstrap Loader (BSL)
The BSL enables users to program the FRAM or RAM using a UART serial interface. Access to the device
memory by the BSL is protected by an user-defined password. Use of the BSL requires four pins (see
Table 5-3). BSL entry requires a specific entry sequence on the RST/NMI/SBWTDIO and TEST/SBWTCK
pins. For complete description of the features of the BSL and its implementation, see the MSP430
Programming Via the Bootstrap Loader User's Guide (SLAU319).

5.7 JTAG Operation
5.7.1 JTAG Standard Interface
The MSP430 family supports the standard JTAG interface, which requires four signals for sending and
receiving data. The JTAG signals are shared with general-purpose I/O. The TEST/SBWTCK pin is used to
enable the JTAG signals. In addition to these signals, the RST/NMI/SBWTDIO is required to interface with
MSP430 development tools and device programmers. The JTAG pin requirements are summarized in
Table 5-4. For further details on interfacing to development tools and device programmers, see the
MSP430 Hardware Tools User's Guide (SLAU278). For a complete description of the features of the JTAG
interface and its implementation, see MSP430 Programming Via the JTAG Interface (SLAU320).

5.7.2 Spy-Bi-Wire Interface
In addition to the standard JTAG interface, the MSP430 family supports the two-wire Spy-Bi-Wire
interface. Spy-Bi-Wire can be used to interface with MSP430 development tools and device programmers.
The Spy-Bi-Wire interface pin requirements are summarized in Table 5-5. For further details on interfacing
to development tools and device programmers, see the MSP430 Hardware Tools User's Guide
(SLAU278). For a complete description of the features of the JTAG interface and its implementation, see
MSP430 Programming Via the JTAG Interface (SLAU320).

5.8 FRAM
The FRAM can be programmed through the JTAG port, Spy-Bi-Wire (SBW), the BSL, or in-system by the
CPU. Features of the FRAM include:
• Low-power ultra-fast write nonvolatile memory
• Byte and word access capability
• Programmable and automated wait state generation
• Error Correction Coding (ECC) with single bit detection and correction, double bit detection
For important software design information regarding FRAM including but not limited to partitioning the
memory layout according to application-specific code, constant, and data space requirements, the use of
FRAM to optimize application energy consumption, and the use of the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) to
maximize application robustness by protecting the program code against unintended write accesses, see
the application report MSP430™ FRAM Technology – How To and Best Practices (SLAA628).
5.9 Memory Protection Unit (MPU)
The FRAM can be protected from inadvertent CPU execution or write access by the MPU. Features of the
MPU include:
• Main memory partitioning programmable up to three segments
• Each segment's (main and information memory) access rights can be individually selected
• Access violation flags with interrupt capability for easy servicing of access violations
5.10 Peripherals
Peripherals are connected to the CPU through data, address, and control buses and can be handled using
all instructions. For complete module descriptions, see the MSP430FR57xx Family User's Guide
(SLAU272).
5.10.1 Digital I/O
There are up to four 8-bit I/O ports implemented:
• All individual I/O bits are independently programmable.
• Any combination of input, output, and interrupt conditions is possible.
• Programmable pullup or pulldown on all ports.
• Edge-selectable interrupt and LPM3.5 and LPM4.5 wake-up input capability is available for all ports.
• Read and write access to port-control registers is supported by all instructions.
• Ports can be accessed byte-wise or word-wise in pairs.

5.10.2 Oscillator and Clock System (CS)
The clock system includes support for a 32-kHz watch crystal oscillator XT1 (LF mode), an internal very-
low-power low-frequency oscillator (VLO), an integrated internal digitally controlled oscillator (DCO), and a
high-frequency crystal oscillator XT1 (HF mode). The clock system module is designed to meet the
requirements of both low system cost and low power consumption. A fail-safe mechanism exists for all
crystal sources. The clock system module provides the following clock signals:
• Auxiliary clock (ACLK), sourced from a 32-kHz watch crystal (XT1 LF mode), a high-frequency crystal
(XT1 HF mode), the internal VLO, or the internal DCO.
• Main clock (MCLK), the system clock used by the CPU. MCLK can be sourced by the same sources
made available to ACLK.
• Sub-Main clock (SMCLK), the subsystem clock used by the peripheral modules. SMCLK can be
sourced by the same sources made available to ACLK.
5.10.3 Power Management Module (PMM)
The PMM includes an integrated voltage regulator that supplies the core voltage to the device. The PMM
also includes supply voltage supervisor (SVS) and brownout protection. The brownout circuit is
implemented to provide the proper internal reset signal to the device during power-on and power-off. The
SVS circuitry detects if the supply voltage drops below a user-selectable safe level. SVS circuitry is
available on the primary and core supplies.
5.10.4 Hardware Multiplier (MPY)
The multiplication operation is supported by a dedicated peripheral module. The module performs
operations with 32-bit, 24-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit operands. The module supports signed and unsigned
multiplication as well as signed and unsigned multiply-and-accumulate operations.
5.10.5 Real-Time Clock (RTC_B)
The RTC_B module contains an integrated real-time clock (RTC) (calendar mode). Calendar mode
integrates an internal calendar which compensates for months with fewer than 31 days and includes leap
year correction. The RTC_B also supports flexible alarm functions and offset-calibration hardware. RTC
operation is available in LPM3.5 mode to minimize power consumption.
5.10.6 Watchdog Timer (WDT_A)
The primary function of the watchdog timer (WDT_A) module is to perform a controlled system restart
after a software problem occurs. If the selected time interval expires, a system reset is generated. If the
watchdog function is not needed in an application, the module can be configured as an interval timer and
can generate interrupts at selected time intervals.
5.10.7 System Module (SYS)
The SYS module handles many of the system functions within the device. These include power-on reset
(POR) and power-up clear (PUC) handling, NMI source selection and management, reset interrupt vector
generators, bootstrap loader entry mechanisms, and configuration management (device descriptors). It
also includes a data exchange mechanism using JTAG called a JTAG mailbox that can be used in the
application.

5.10.8 DMA Controller
The DMA controller allows movement of data from one memory address to another without CPU
intervention. For example, the DMA controller can be used to move data from the ADC10_B conversion
memory to RAM. Using the DMA controller can increase the throughput of peripheral modules. The DMA
controller reduces system power consumption by allowing the CPU to remain in sleep mode, without
having to awaken to move data to or from a peripheral.

(1) Setting P1SEL1.x and P1SEL0.x disables the output driver as well as the input Schmitt trigger to prevent parasitic cross currents when
applying analog signals.
(2) Not available on all devices and package types.
(3) Setting the CDPD.x bit of the comparator disables the output driver as well as the input Schmitt trigger to prevent parasitic cross
currents when applying analog signals. Selecting the CDx input pin to the comparator multiplexer with the CDx bits automatically
disables output driver and input buffer for that pin, regardless of the state of the associated CDPD.x bit.

applying analog signals.
(3) Not available on all devices and package types.
(4) Setting the CDPD.x bit of the comparator disables the output driver and the input Schmitt trigger to prevent parasitic cross currents
when applying analog signals. Selecting the CDx input pin to the comparator multiplexer with the CDx bits automatically disables output
driver and input buffer for that pin, regardless of the state of the associated CDPD.x bit.

This device is supported by Code Composer Studio™ IDE (CCS).
8.1.2.3.2 MSP430Ware
MSP430Ware is a collection of code examples, data sheets, and other design resources for all MSP430
devices delivered in a convenient package. In addition to providing a complete collection of existing
MSP430 design resources, MSP430Ware also includes a high-level API called MSP430 Driver Library.
This library makes it easy to program MSP430 hardware. MSP430Ware is available as a component of
CCS or as a standalone package.
8.1.2.3.3 Command-Line Programmer
MSP430 Flasher is an open-source, shell-based interface for programming MSP430 microcontrollers
through a FET programmer or eZ430 using JTAG or Spy-Bi-Wire (SBW) communication. MSP430 Flasher
can be used to download binary files (.txt or .hex) files directly to the MSP430 microcontroller without the
need for an IDE.
8.1.3 Device and Development Tool Nomenclature
To designate the stages in the product development cycle, TI assigns prefixes to the part numbers of all
MSP430 MCU devices and support tools. Each MSP430 MCU commercial family member has one of
three prefixes: MSP, PMS, or XMS (for example, MSP430F5259). Texas Instruments recommends two of
three possible prefix designators for its support tools: MSP and MSPX. These prefixes represent
evolutionary stages of product development from engineering prototypes (with XMS for devices and MSPX
for tools) through fully qualified production devices and tools (with MSP for devices and MSP for tools).
Device development evolutionary flow:
XMS – Experimental device that is not necessarily representative of the final device's electrical
specifications
PMS – Final silicon die that conforms to the device's electrical specifications but has not completed quality
and reliability verification
MSP – Fully qualified production device
Support tool development evolutionary flow:
MSPX – Development-support product that has not yet completed Texas Instruments internal qualification
testing.
MSP – Fully-qualified development-support product
XMS and PMS devices and MSPX development-support tools are shipped against the following
disclaimer:
"Developmental product is intended for internal evaluation purposes."
MSP devices and MSP development-support tools have been characterized fully, and the quality and
reliability of the device have been demonstrated fully. TI's standard warranty applies.
Predictions show that prototype devices (XMS and PMS) have a greater failure rate than the standard
production devices. Texas Instruments recommends that these devices not be used in any production
system because their expected end-use failure rate still is undefined. Only qualified production devices are
to be used.
TI device nomenclature also includes a suffix with the device family name. This suffix indicates the
package type (for example, PZP) and temperature range (for example, T). Figure 8-1 provides a legend
for reading the complete device name for any family member.
