1.1
Direct Memory Access (DMA) Introduction
The DMA controller transfers data from one address to another, without CPU intervention, across the
entire address range. For example, the DMA controller can move data from the ADC conversion memory
to RAM.
Devices that contain a DMA controller may have up to eight DMA channels available. Therefore,
depending on the number of DMA channels available, some features described in this chapter are not
applicable to all devices. See the device-specific data sheet for number of channels supported.
Using the DMA controller can increase the throughput of peripheral modules. It can also reduce system
power consumption by allowing the CPU to remain in a low-power mode, without having to awaken to
move data to or from a peripheral.
DMA controller features include:
•
Up to eight independent transfer channels
•
Configurable DMA channel priorities
•
Requires only two MCLK clock cycles per transfer
•
Byte or word and mixed byte and word transfer capability
•
Block sizes up to 65535 bytes or words
•
Configurable transfer trigger selections
•
Selectable edge- or level-triggered transfer
•
Four addressing modes
•
Single, block, or burst-block transfer modes

DMA Operation
The DMA controller is configured with user software. The setup and operation of the DMA is discussed in
the following sections.
1.2.1
DMA Addressing Modes
The DMA controller has four addressing modes. The addressing mode for each DMA channel is
independently configurable. For example, channel 0 may transfer between two fixed addresses, while
channel 1 transfers between two blocks of addresses. Figure 1-2 shows the addressing modes. The
addressing modes are:
•
Fixed address to fixed address
•
Fixed address to block of addresses
•
Block of addresses to fixed address
•
Block of addresses to block of addresses
The addressing modes are configured with the DMASRCINCR and DMADSTINCR control bits. The
DMASRCINCR bits select if the source address is incremented, decremented, or unchanged after each
transfer. The DMADSTINCR bits select if the destination address is incremented, decremented, or
unchanged after each transfer.
Transfers may be byte to byte, word to word, byte to word, or word to byte. When transferring word to
byte, only the lower byte of the source word is transfered. When transferring byte to word, the upper byte
of the destination word is cleared when the transfer occurs.

1.2.2
DMA Transfer Modes
The DMA controller has six transfer modes selected by the DMADT bits (see Table 1-1). Each channel is
individually configurable for its transfer mode. For example, channel 0 may be configured in single transfer
mode, while channel 1 is configured for burst-block transfer mode, and channel 2 operates in repeated
block mode. The transfer mode is configured independently from the addressing mode. Any addressing
mode can be used with any transfer mode.
Two types of data can be transferred selectable by the DMAxCTL DSTBYTE and SRCBYTE fields. The
source and destination location can be either byte or word data. It is also possible to transfer byte to byte,
word to word, or any combination.

1.2.2.1
Single Transfer
In single transfer mode, each byte or word transfer requires a separate trigger. Figure 1-3 shows the
single transfer state diagram.
The DMAxSZ register defines the number of transfers to be made. The DMADSTINCR and
DMASRCINCR bits select if the destination address and the source address are incremented or
decremented after each transfer. If DMAxSZ = 0, no transfers occur.
The DMAxSA, DMAxDA, and DMAxSZ registers are copied into temporary registers. The temporary
values of DMAxSA and DMAxDA are incremented or decremented after each transfer. The DMAxSZ
register is decremented after each transfer. When the DMAxSZ register decrements to zero, it is reloaded
from its temporary register and the corresponding DMAIFG flag is set. When DMADT = {0}, the DMAEN
bit is cleared automatically when DMAxSZ decrements to zero and must be set again for another transfer
to occur.
In repeated single transfer mode, the DMA controller remains enabled with DMAEN = 1, and a transfer
occurs every time a trigger occurs.

1.2.2.2
Block Transfer
In block transfer mode, a transfer of a complete block of data occurs after one trigger. When DMADT = {1}
,the DMAEN bit is cleared after the completion of the block transfer and must be set again before another
block transfer can be triggered. After a block transfer has been triggered, further trigger signals occurring
during the block transfer are ignored. Figure 1-4 shows the block transfer state diagram.
The DMAxSZ register is used to define the size of the block, and the DMADSTINCR and DMASRCINCR
bits select if the destination address and the source address are incremented or decremented after each
transfer of the block. If DMAxSZ = 0, no transfers occur.
The DMAxSA, DMAxDA, and DMAxSZ registers are copied into temporary registers. The temporary
values of DMAxSA and DMAxDA are incremented or decremented after each transfer in the block. The
DMAxSZ register is decremented after each transfer of the block and shows the number of transfers
remaining in the block. When the DMAxSZ register decrements to zero, it is reloaded from its temporary
register and the corresponding DMAIFG flag is set.
During a block transfer, the CPU is halted until the complete block has been transferred. The block
transfer takes 2 × MCLK × DMAxSZ clock cycles to complete. CPU execution resumes with its previous
state after the block transfer is complete.
In repeated block transfer mode, the DMAEN bit remains set after completion of the block transfer. The
next trigger after the completion of a repeated block transfer triggers another block transfer.

1.2.2.3
Burst-Block Transfer
In burst-block mode, transfers are block transfers with CPU activity interleaved. The CPU executes
two MCLK cycles after every four byte/word transfers of the block, resulting in 20% CPU execution
capacity. After the burst-block, CPU execution resumes at 100% capacity and the DMAEN bit is cleared.
DMAEN must be set again before another burst-block transfer can be triggered. After a burst-block
transfer has been triggered, further trigger signals occurring during the burst-block transfer are ignored.
Figure 1-5 shows the burst-block transfer state diagram.
The DMAxSZ register is used to define the size of the block, and the DMADSTINCR and DMASRCINCR
bits select if the destination address and the source address are incremented or decremented after each
transfer of the block. If DMAxSZ = 0, no transfers occur.
The DMAxSA, DMAxDA, and DMAxSZ registers are copied into temporary registers. The temporary
values of DMAxSA and DMAxDA are incremented or decremented after each transfer in the block. The
DMAxSZ register is decremented after each transfer of the block and shows the number of transfers
remaining in the block. When the DMAxSZ register decrements to zero, it is reloaded from its temporary
register and the corresponding DMAIFG flag is set.
In repeated burst-block mode, the DMAEN bit remains set after completion of the burst-block transfer and
no further trigger signals are required to initiate another burst-block transfer. Another burst-block transfer
begins immediately after completion of a burst-block transfer. In this case, the transfers must be stopped
by clearing the DMAEN bit, or by an (non)maskable interrupt (NMI) when ENNMI is set. In repeated burst-
block mode, the CPU executes at 20% capacity continuously until the repeated burst-block transfer is
stopped.

1.2.3
Initiating DMA Transfers
The trigger source for each DMA channel is independently configured by DMAxTSEL. The DMAxTSEL
bits should be modified only when the DMAxCTL DMAEN bit is 0. Otherwise, unpredictable DMA triggers
may occur. Table 1-2 describes the trigger operation for each type of module. See the device-specific data
sheet for the list of triggers available, along with their respective DMAxTSEL values.
When selecting the trigger, the trigger must not have already occurred, or the transfer does not take place.
NOTE:
DMA trigger selection and USB
On devices that contain a USB module, the triggers selection from DMA channels 0, 1, or 2
can be used for the USB time stamp event selection (see the USB module description for
further details).
1.2.3.1
Edge-Sensitive Triggers
When DMALEVEL = 0, edge-sensitive triggers are used, and the rising edge of the trigger signal initiates
the transfer. In single-transfer mode, each transfer requires its own trigger. When using block or burst-
block modes, only one trigger is required to initiate the block or burst-block transfer.
1.2.3.2
Level-Sensitive Triggers
When DMALEVEL = 1, level-sensitive triggers are used. For proper operation, level-sensitive triggers can
only be used when external trigger DMAE0 is selected as the trigger. DMA transfers are triggered as long
as the trigger signal is high and the DMAEN bit remains set.
The trigger signal must remain high for a block or burst-block transfer to complete. If the trigger signal
goes low during a block or burst-block transfer, the DMA controller is held in its current state until the
trigger goes back high or until the DMA registers are modified by software. If the DMA registers are not
modified by software, when the trigger signal goes high again, the transfer resumes from where it was
when the trigger signal went low.
When DMALEVEL = 1, transfer modes selected by DMADT = {0, 1, 2, or 3} are recommended because
the DMAEN bit is automatically reset after the configured transfer.
1.2.4
Halting Executing Instructions for DMA Transfers
The DMARMWDIS bit controls when the CPU is halted for DMA transfers. When DMARMWDIS = 0, the
CPU is halted immediately and the transfer begins when a trigger is received. In this case, it is possible
that CPU read-modify-write operations can be interrupted by a DMA transfer. When DMARMWDIS = 1,
the CPU finishes the currently executing read-modify-write operation before the DMA controller halts the
CPU and the transfer begins (see Table 1-2).

Operation
DMA
A transfer is triggered when the DMAREQ bit is set. The DMAREQ bit is automatically reset when the transfer starts.
A transfer is triggered when the DMAxIFG flag is set. DMA0IFG triggers channel 1, DMA1IFG triggers channel 2, and
DMA2IFG triggers channel 0. None of the DMAxIFG flags are automatically reset when the transfer starts.
A transfer is triggered by the external trigger DMAE0.
Timer_A
A transfer is triggered when the TAxCCR0 CCIFG flag is set. The TAxCCR0 CCIFG flag is automatically reset when the
transfer starts. If the TAxCCR0 CCIE bit is set, the TAxCCR0 CCIFG flag dies not trigger a transfer.
A transfer is triggered when the TAxCCR2 CCIFG flag is set. The TAxCCR2 CCIFG flag is automatically reset when the
transfer starts. If the TAxCCR2 CCIE bit is set, the TAxCCR2 CCIFG flag does not trigger a transfer.
Timer_B
A transfer is triggered when the TBxCCR0 CCIFG flag is set. The TBxCCR0 CCIFG flag is automatically reset when the
transfer starts. If the TBxCCR0 CCIE bit is set, the TBxCCR0 CCIFG flag does not trigger a transfer.
A transfer is triggered when the TBxCCR2 CCIFG flag is set. The TBxCCR2 CCIFG flag is automatically reset when the
transfer starts. If the TBxCCR2 CCIE bit is set, the TBxCCR2 CCIFG flag does not trigger a transfer.
USCI_Ax
A transfer is triggered when USCI_Ax receives new data. UCAxRXIFG is automatically reset when the transfer starts. If
UCAxRXIE is set, the UCAxRXIFG does not trigger a transfer.
A transfer is triggered when USCI_Ax is ready to transmit new data. UCAxTXIFG is automatically reset when the
transfer starts. If UCAxTXIE is set, the UCAxTXIFG does not trigger a transfer.
USCI_Bx
A transfer is triggered when USCI_Bx receives new data. UCBxRXIFG is automatically reset when the transfer starts. If
UCBxRXIE is set, the UCBxRXIFG does not trigger a transfer.
A transfer is triggered when USCI_Bx is ready to transmit new data. UCBxTXIFG is automatically reset when the
transfer starts. If UCBxTXIE is set, the UCBxTXIFG does not trigger a transfer.
DAC12_A
A transfer is triggered when the DAC12_xCTL0 DAC12IFG flag is set. The DAC12_xCTL0 DAC12IFG flag is
automatically cleared when the transfer starts. If the DAC12_xCTL0 DAC12IE bit is set, the DAC12_xCTL0 DAC12IFG
flag does not trigger a transfer.
ADC10_A
A transfer is triggered by an ADC10IFG0 flag with the ADC10IE0 bit reset. A transfer is triggered when the conversion
is completed and the ADC10IFG0 is set. Setting the ADC10IFG0 with software does not trigger a transfer. The
ADC10IFG0 flag is automatically reset when the ADC10MEM0 register is accessed by the DMA controller.
ADC12_A
A transfer is triggered by an ADC12IFG flag with the corresponding ADC12IE bit reset. When single-channel
conversions are performed, the corresponding ADC12IFG is the trigger. When sequences are used, the ADC12IFG for
the last conversion in the sequence is the trigger. A transfer is triggered when the conversion is completed and the
ADC12IFG is set. Setting the ADC12IFG with software does not trigger a transfer. All ADC12IFG flags are automatically
reset when the associated ADC12MEMx register is accessed by the DMA controller.
MPY
A transfer is triggered when the hardware multiplier is ready for a new operand.
Reserved
No transfer is triggered.
1.2.5
Stopping DMA Transfers
There are two ways to stop DMA transfers in progress:
•
A single, block, or burst-block transfer may be stopped with an NMI, if the ENNMI bit is set in register
DMACTL1.
•
A burst-block transfer may be stopped by clearing the DMAEN bit.
1.2.6
DMA Channel Priorities
The default DMA channel priorities are DMA0 through DMA7. If two or three triggers happen
simultaneously or are pending, the channel with the highest priority completes its transfer (single, block, or
burst-block transfer) first, then the second priority channel, then the third priority channel. Transfers in
progress are not halted if a higher-priority channel is triggered. The higher-priority channel waits until the
transfer in progress completes before starting.
The DMA channel priorities are configurable with the ROUNDROBIN bit. When the ROUNDROBIN bit is
set, the channel that completes a transfer becomes the lowest priority. The order of the priority of the
channels always stays the same, DMA0-DMA1-DMA2, for example, for three channels. When the
ROUNDROBIN bit is cleared, the channel priority returns to the default priority.

1.2.7
DMA Transfer Cycle Time
The DMA controller requires one or two MCLK clock cycles to synchronize before each single transfer or
complete block or burst-block transfer. Each byte/word transfer requires two MCLK cycles after
synchronization, and one cycle of wait time after the transfer. Because the DMA controller uses MCLK, the
DMA cycle time depends on the MSP430 operating mode and clock system setup.
If the MCLK source is active but the CPU is off, the DMA controller uses the MCLK source for each
transfer, without enabling the CPU. If the MCLK source is off, the DMA controller temporarily restarts
MCLK, sourced with DCOCLK, for the single transfer or complete block or burst-block transfer. The CPU
remains off, and MCLK is turned off after the transfer completes. Table 1-3 lists the maximum DMA cycle
times for all operating modes.
(1)
The additional 5 µs are needed to start the DCOCLK. It is the t(LPMx)
parameter in the data sheet.

1.2.8
Using DMA With System Interrupts
DMA transfers are not interruptible by system interrupts. System interrupts remain pending until the
completion of the transfer. NMIs can interrupt the DMA controller if the ENNMI bit is set.
System interrupt service routines are interrupted by DMA transfers. If an interrupt service routine or other
routine must execute with no interruptions, the DMA controller should be disabled prior to executing the
routine.
1.2.9
DMA Controller Interrupts
Each DMA channel has its own DMAIFG flag. Each DMAIFG flag is set in any mode when the
corresponding DMAxSZ register counts to zero. If the corresponding DMAIE and GIE bits are set, an
interrupt request is generated.
All DMAIFG flags are prioritized, with DMA0IFG being the highest, and combined to source a single
interrupt vector. The highest-priority enabled interrupt generates a number in the DMAIV register. This
number can be evaluated or added to the program counter (PC) to automatically enter the appropriate
software routine. Disabled DMA interrupts do not affect the DMAIV value.
Any access (read or write) of the DMAIV register automatically resets the highest pending interrupt flag. If
another interrupt flag is set, another interrupt is immediately generated after servicing the initial interrupt.
For example, assume that DMA0 has the highest priority. If the DMA0IFG and DMA2IFG flags are set
when the interrupt service routine accesses the DMAIV register, DMA0IFG is reset automatically. After the
RETI instruction of the interrupt service routine is executed, the DMA2IFG generates another interrupt.

Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller Module
Chapter Excerpt from SLAU208
1.2.10
Using the USCI_B I2C Module With the DMA Controller
The USCI_B I2C module provides two trigger sources for the DMA controller. The USCI_B I2C module can
trigger a transfer when new I2C data is received and when the transmit data is needed.
1.2.11
Using ADC10 With the DMA Controller
MSP430 devices with an integrated DMA controller can automatically move data from the ADC10MEM0
register to another location. DMA transfers are done without CPU intervention and are independent of any
low-power modes. The DMA controller increases throughput of the ADC10 module and enhances low-
power applications by allowing the CPU to remain off while data transfers occur.
A transfer is triggered when the conversion is completed and the ADC10IFG0 is set as long as the
ADC10IE0 bit is reset. Setting the ADC10IFG0 with software does not trigger a transfer. The ADC10IFG0
flag is automatically reset when the ADC10MEM0 register is accessed by the DMA controller.
1.2.12
Using ADC12 With the DMA Controller
MSP430 devices with an integrated DMA controller can automatically move data from any ADC12MEMx
register to another location. DMA transfers are done without CPU intervention and are independent of any
low-power modes. The DMA controller increases throughput of the ADC12 module and enhances low-
power applications by allowing the CPU to remain off while data transfers occur.
DMA transfers can be triggered from any ADC12IFG flag as long as the corresponding ADC12IE bit is
reset. When CONSEQx = {0,2}, the ADC12IFG flag for the ADC12MEMx used for the conversion can
trigger a DMA transfer. When CONSEQx = {1,3}, the ADC12IFG flag for the last ADC12MEMx in the
sequence can trigger a DMA transfer. Any ADC12IFG flag is automatically cleared when the DMA
controller accesses the corresponding ADC12MEMx.
1.2.13
Using DAC12 With the DMA Controller
MSP430 devices with an integrated DMA controller can automatically move data to the DAC12_xDAT
register. DMA transfers are done without CPU intervention and are independent of any low-power modes.
The DMA controller increases throughput to the DAC12 module and enhances low-power applications by
allowing the CPU to remain off while data transfers occur.
Applications that require periodic waveform generation can benefit from using the DMA controller with the
DAC12. For example, an application that produces a sinusoidal waveform may store the sinusoid values
in a table. The DMA controller can continuously and automatically transfer the values to the DAC12 at
specific intervals to create the sinusoid with no CPU execution. The DAC12_xCTL DAC12IFG flag is
automatically cleared when the DMA controller accesses the DAC12_xDAT register.

DMA source address. The source address register points to the DMA source
address for single transfers or the first source address for block transfers. The
source address register remains unchanged during block and burst-block
transfers. There are two words for the DMAxSA register. Bits 31-20 are
reserved and always read as zero. Reading or writing bits 19-16 requires the
use of extended instructions. When writing to DMAxSA with word instructions,
bits 19-16 are cleared.

DMA destination address. The destination address register points to the DMA
destination address for single transfers or the first destination address for block
transfers. The destination address register remains unchanged during block and
burst-block transfers. There are two words for the DMAxDA register. Bits 31-20
are reserved and always read as zero. Reading or writing bits 19-16 requires
the use of extended instructions. When writing to DMAxDA with word
instructions, bits 19-16 are cleared.

DMA size. The DMA size register defines the number of byte/word data per
block transfer. DMAxSZ register decrements with each word or byte transfer.
When DMAxSZ decrements to 0, it is immediately and automatically reloaded
with its previously initialized value.
00000h = Transfer is disabled.
00001h = One byte or word is transferred.
00002h = Two bytes or words are transferred.
⋮
0FFFFh = 65535 bytes or words are transferred.
